# Junior Programmer: Create with Code 1

This first mission in the Junior Programmer pathway will provide you with the core foundation needed to create a wide range of digital experiences in Unity. You’ll learn about fundamental programming concepts such as variables, functions and basic logic through two practical projects. You’ll also modify a script to customize a simple Unity experience: the beginning of your personal portfolio.

**Key details**

- This mission will take you approximately 14 hours to complete. Take it at your own pace — you’ll receive XP each step of the way.  
- Connect with the Unity community as you learn and check the Live calendar for follow-along practical sessions with Unity established creators.
- When you’ve finished the mission, you’ll get the mission badge for your profile and portfolio.
